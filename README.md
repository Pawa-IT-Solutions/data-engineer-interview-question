## Problem Statement: Analyzing Student Performance
 - You are given a dataset containing information about students' performance in exams. Your task is to perform basic data analysis and answer some questions about the dataset.

## Dataset Description:
#### The dataset contains the following columns:
 - `gender`: Gender of the student (male/female)
 - `race/ethnicity`: Race/ethnicity of the student (`['luhya', 'kikuyu', 'maasai', 'luo', 'kamba', 'kisii', 'meru', 'taita']`)
 - `parental level of education`: Parental level of education (['kcpe', 'kcse', 'polytechnic', 'university'])
 - `lunch`: Type of lunch received by the student (standard, free/reduced)
 - `test preparation course`: Whether the student completed a test preparation course (none, completed)
 - `math score`: Score obtained by the student in math exam (out of 100)
 - `reading score`: Score obtained by the student in reading exam (out of 100)
 - `writing score`: Score obtained by the student in the writing exam (out of 100)

#### Tasks:
 - Load the dataset (`student_performance.csv`) into a pandas DataFrame.
 - Display basic statistics about the dataset, such as `mean`, `median`, and `standard deviation` of exam scores.
 - Visualize the distribution of exam scores using histograms.
 - Calculate the overall average score (average of math, reading, and writing scores) for each student.

#### Answer the following questions:
 - What is the average math score for male students?
 - What percentage of students completed the test preparation course?
 - Is there any correlation between parental level of education and student performance? Visualize if necessary.
 - Are students from group C more likely to receive standard lunch compared to other groups?
    - Optionally, explore additional insights or visualizations based on your analysis.

#### Submission:
 - Submit your code (Python script or Jupyter Notebook) along with any necessary files (e.g., dataset) and a brief summary of your findings.

 - This assessment evaluates candidates' ability to perform basic data analysis tasks, manipulate data using pandas, visualize data, and draw insights from the dataset.


## Test Requirements:
 - Python version 3 installed
 - Jupyter Notebook / Collab
